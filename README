SUBROUTINES/METHODS
  new
        my $ceilapi = Net::OpenStack::Ceilometer->new(

            http => 'https', # If you want https
        );

  get_auth_token
    FIXME Note that this should probably call a higher-level Net::OpenStack
    method, but those modules are still a mystery to me.

    Gets auth token from Horizon

  resources
        my @resources = $ceilapi->resources();

  resource
        my $resource = $ceilapi->resource( $id );

  meters
    Returns an arraref of all meters.

        my $meters = $ceilapi->meters();

  meter, meter_by_name, meter_by_id
        my $meter = $ceilapi->meter_by_id( $id );
        my $meter = $ceilapi->meter( $id );
        my $meter = $ceilapi->meter_by_name( $name );

  statistics
    Computes the statistics of the samples in the time range given.

    Parameters: q (list(Query)) – Filter rules for the data to be returned.
    groupby (list(unicode)) – Fields for group by aggregation period (int) –
